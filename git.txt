how does it work
----------------
1) git is used to track something

a) git i want to track this thing
b) if you don't want to track something, you add it to gitignore file
c) git i have updated the file 


1) git init ===> initialise ---> git I want to start tracking the content of this folder
2) git status ===> it will tell what is going on
3) git add fileName/folderName/etc ===> git track this thing
4) git log ===> it will show you all the version that you have
5) git commit -m "what did I do/achieve" ===> we use commit to seal a version

to clone a repo/project means to have acces to that repo on your computer
